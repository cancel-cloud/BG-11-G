# 🏫 Chronicles of the 11BG G Codex 📚

## Prologue

Greetings, digital voyagers!
You've stumbled upon the sacred scripts where 11BG G chronicles its code creations—both our magnum opuses and the...
"experimental runes".
But heed this warning: the codekeeper Lukas watches over
these scrolls with an eagle's gaze. 🦉

## Lukas's Code Castle 🏰

Behold, the Code Cave—a sanctum of syntax and semicolons. In the heart of Lukas's lair,
algorithms dance and functions flourish.
Though a byte might bite or a bit might slip, together we navigate the nuances of the net.
While the keeper's methods may seem arcane,
his keyboard is not enchanted (or so we think).

## Diving into the Depths 📜

- `Dica's Microsoft Missions/`: Where the microsoft suit is fully used to pursue new dreams.
- `Mr Big's Website Workshop/`: New ventures in the world of web development.
- `iOSIsles/`: Sail to
  the [external archipelago](https://github.com/cancel-cloud/iOSDevelopmentExploration?tab=readme-ov-file) where Apple
  orchards grow apps aplenty.

## Codex Commandments 🖋

1. Avoid the abyss of infinite loops; Lukas might get trapped.
2. Pen your prose clearly; cryptic runes confound the cove.
3. Before your code is canonized, it must face the keeper's council (aka code critiques).

## Embarking on an Epic 🌌

1. Mirror the manuscript (fork the repository).
2. Stake your scriptorium (branch out).
3. Scribe your saga (commit your code).
4. Petition for your page's place (initiate a pull request).

## Honors and Homage 🌟

Tip your cap to Lukas, the legend who allegedly unlocked the labyrinth of lambda expressions
last lunar cycle. Our admiration is astral.
